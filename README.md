Although the idea is to make a push and install interface, during the first versions still some manual installations will be needed. Just read the how-to file to gain information about this and how to use PocketInstaller. 

YAD is used for the interface:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/yad-dialog/ 

Zenity is used for of the launchers interface:

Pocket Home (by @o-marshmallow) is highly recommended for a great experience:

Also, all the game installers and config files have been created taking the job previously done by some great people at the Next Thing Co's forums:

PocketInstaller has been created by Damian Vila (@damianvila) and Iker García. 

**Motivation** 

Pocket C.H.I.P is an amazing Linux handheld machine. It allows, and will allow more in the future, several uses being one of the most popular ones turning it into a portable emulator/game machine. However, in order to install the software a heavy use of terminal is needed and this can be awful for user with few experience. This is way Damian Vila proposed at the forums the creation of this tool. We teamed up and this is the result. 

**Contributors** 

Everyone can contribute to this project, improving the code or adding functions. If anyone wants something to be added to the installer we will try to do it. Also, .sh files and config files are always welcome, so we just need to add the pushed software to the main GUI.
